Simulator starts with the some basic instructions which the user need to read carefully. First we have to turn on the power supply. First students have to switch on the power and set the appropriate voltage and current readings. This power supply will heat up the metal rod which is covered with the PoP insulation. After the heating temperatures would be developed on metal surface and insulation surface and with the help of Newtonâ€™s Law of cooling convectivity coefficient could be evaluated and it will help to calculate the critical thickness of insulation. After this , we have to insert the value of components like as diameter of the metal rod, voltmeter ,ammeter and the value of connective heat transfer co-efficient. By this we will get the value of critical radius. We will provide appropriate amount of heat to the workpiece in the form of (Q=VI). We will determine amount of heat conducted from metal rod to insulation and amount of heat convected from insulation to temperature. The main purpose is to determine the critical radius upto which amount of heat transfer could be increased.
