### Aim 
To study the critical radius phenomena and to show experimentally that heat loss across the insulation is maximum at critical radius, provided the convection boundary condition at outer surface is constant. 
### Theory 
It is a well-known fact that the addition of insulating material on a surface always reduce the amount of heat flow to the ambient. There are some instances in which the addition of insulation to the outside surface of cylinder or spherical wall does not reduce the heat loss. In fact under certain circumstances it actually increases the heat loss up to a certain thickness of insulation. 
It is known that adding more insulation to a wall or spherical surface always decreases heat transfer.  The thicker the insulation, the lower will be the heat transfer rate. This is expected since the heat transfer area A is constant, and adding insulation always increases the thermal resistance of the wall without increasing the convection resistance. Adding insulation to a cylindrical pipe or spherical wall, however is a different manner. The additional insulation increases the conduction resistance of the insulation layer but decreases the convection resistance of the surface because of the increase in the outer surface area for convection. The heat transfer from the pipe may increases or decreases depending upon which effect dominates.

The thickness upto which heat transfer increases and after which heat transfer this decrease is termed as critical radius.
Let the tube of radius rt and the temperature Tt be covered with insulation. At the outer radius of the insulation ro , a surface coefficient ha is assumed for heat transfer to the atmosphere at temperature ta. As ro increases and Q decreases. Again as ro increases, Ao increases and Q increases. There is an optimum ro at which Q is the maximum.
For Maximum heat transfer:

k= thermal conductivity of insulation
ha= heat transfer coefficient of atmosphere
