#### 3. Instructional Strategy

<u> <b>Name of Instructional Strategy  : </b> First students have to switch on the power and set the appropriate voltage and current readings. This power supply will heat up the metal rod which is covered with the PoP insulation. After the heating temperatures would be developed on metal surface and insulation surface and with the help of Newton’s Law of cooling convectivity coefficient could be evaluated and it will help to calculate the critical thickness of insulation. 
    
<u> <b>Assessment Method: </b>  Assessment could be done on the basis of viva-voce.  

<u> <b>Description: </b> of how you are going to implement the above Instructional Strategy in your Simulator: </u>
<br>
  In simulator a workpiece has taken on which a layer of insulation is considered. When the simulator starts and voltage and current value will be provided then heating would be started and on the basis of the heating simulator will provide temperature value and automatic calculation will occur that will give convectivity coefficient value and critical radius of insulation value.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Activity description <br> Student will switch  <br> on the power button | Click on the  <br> 'Start Button’   | The main purpose is to provide power supply to the apparatus.
2.| Activity description <br> Student will set the appropriate  <br> value of voltage and current | Click on the <br> ‘voltage and current rheostat '  | The main purpose is to provide appropriate amount of heat to the workpiece (Q=VI)
3.| Activity description <br> Student will wait for the steady state and  <br> note down the temperature | Click on the  <br> ‘Temperature value will be displayed '  | The main purpose is to determine amount of heat conducted from metal rod to insulation and amount of heat convected from insulation  to atmosphere.
4.| Activity description <br> Student will perform the calculation part and  <br> get the value of required result. | Click on the <br> ‘Show result and automatic calculation will be done which will give the required result. '  | The main purpose is to determine the critical radius upto which amount of heat transfer could be increased.
