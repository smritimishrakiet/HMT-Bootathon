<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

Heat  and Mass transfer is the flow of thermal energy driven by thermal non-equilibrium (i.e. the effect of a non-
uniform temperature field), commonly measured as a heat flux (vector), i.e. the heat flow per unit time (and 
usually unit normal area) at a control surface.The aim here is to understand heat transfer modelling, but the actual goal of most heat transfer (modelling) 
problems is to find the temperature field and heat fluxes in a material domain, given a previous knowledge 
of the subject , and a set of particular constraints: boundary 
conditions (BC), initial conditions (IC), distribution of sources or sinks (loads), etc.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

This experiment will give the knowledge about the critical radius of the material and how it is important in the analysis of heat transfer. This experiment will be helpful for students of mechanical engineering as well as faculty member of the same department.
<h5> Target Audience : </h5>
Students of mechanical engineering department (Specially 5th semester students) and faculty members

<h5> Course Alignment : </h5>

B.Tech MECHANICAL ENGINEERING

<h5> Universities Mapped : </h5>
