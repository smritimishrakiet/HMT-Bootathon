<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

Heat and Mass transfer is the flow of thermal energy driven by thermal non-equilibrium (i.e. the effect of a non-
uniform temperature field), commonly measured as a heat flux (vector), i.e. the heat flow per unit time (and 
usually unit normal area) at a control surface.
The aim here is to understand heat transfer modelling, but the actual goal of most heat transfer (modelling) 
problems is to find the temperature field and heat fluxes in a material domain, given a previous knowledge 
of the subject (general partial differential equations, PDE), and a set of particular constraints: boundary 
conditions (BC), initial conditions (IC), distribution of sources or sinks (loads), etc. There are also many 
cases where the interest is just to know when the heat-transfer process finishes, and in a few other cases the 
goal is not in the direct problem (given the PDE+BC+IC, find the T-field) but on the inverse problem: given 
the T-field and some aspects of PDE+BC+IC, find some missing parameters (identification problem), e.g. 
finding the required dimensions or materials for a certain heat insulation or conduction goal.
Heat-transfer problems arise in many industrial and environmental processes, particularly in energy 
utilization, thermal processing, and thermal control. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but so-common 
it is to use energy as synonymous of exergy, or the quality of energy, than it is commonly said that energy 
utilization is concerned with energy generation from primary sources (e.g. fossil fuels, solar), to end-user 
energy consumption (e.g. electricity and fuel consumption), through all possible intermediate steps of energy 
valorisation, energy transportation, energy storage, and energy conversion processes. 

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>
