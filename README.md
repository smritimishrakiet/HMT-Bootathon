<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

Heat & Mass Transfer Laboratory caters to the needs of B.Tech. 3rd year Mechanical Engineering. There are 10 experimental setups available in the laboratory. They are- 1. Natural convection apparatus 2. Force convection apparatus 3. Stephan-Boltzmann apparatus 4. Composite wall apparatus 5. Specific heat apparatus 6. Heat Pipe Demonstration 7. Parallel flow/Counter flow heat exchanger test rig 8. Plate fin heat exchanger test rig 9. Critical radius apparatus 10. Thermal conductivity apparatus These experiments help the students to understand all the 3 modes of heat transfer, namely conduction, convection and radiation practically. These experiments also pave way for inculcating certain innovative skills in the students making them to use the above experimental setups as starting point to take up higher level experimental studies in Heat Transfer.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

This experiment will give the knowledge about the critical radius of the material and how it is important in the analysis of heat transfer. This experiment will be helpful for students of mechanical engineering as well as faculty member of the same department.
<h5> Target Audience : </h5>
Students of mechanical engineering department (Specially 5th semester students) and faculty members

<h5> Course Alignment : </h5>

In this course student will be able to learn about the analysis of heat flow in any cylindrical surface when the outer layer of the surface is insulated completely. This experiment engage students in analysis and prepare them to achieve the intended learning objectives.
